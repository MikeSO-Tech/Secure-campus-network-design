Guest ACL Isolation (Extended ACL Validation)

## Purpose
Validate that the Extended ACL applied at the distribution layer
restricts Guest VLAN (VLAN 40) traffic from accessing internal
networks while allowing outbound access to the ISP network.

## Environment
| Device | VLAN | Subnet | Role |
|--------|------|--------|------|
| Guest Laptop | 40 | 192.168.40.0/24 | Test source |
| Machine PC | 20 | 192.168.20.0/24 | Internal resource |
| Factory Server | 50 | 192.168.50.0/24 | Internal resource |
| ISP File Server | External | 130.100.30.8/30 | Allowed destination |

ACL Location: **Distribution switch (SVI VLAN 40, inbound)**

---

## Validation Method
ICMP testing from the Guest laptop is used to confirm:
- Denied access to all internal VLANs
- Allowed access to external ISP resources

## Expected Results
| Source | Destination | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| VLAN 40 | VLAN 20 | BLOCKED |
| VLAN 40 | VLAN 50 | BLOCKED |
| VLAN 40 | ISP File Server | PASS |

## Test Steps
1. Log into Guest laptop
2. Verify DHCP address in 192.168.40.0/24
3. Ping internal VLAN gateways (20, 50)
4. Ping ISP file server (130.100.30.10)
5. Capture screenshots

## Outcome
**PASS** — ACL enforces segmentation and allows controlled internet access for Guest users.
