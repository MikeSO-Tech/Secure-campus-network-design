# DHCP vs Static Addressing Validation

## Purpose
Verify that all user endpoints receive dynamic IP addresses via DHCP,
while critical servers use static IP addressing with correct gateway
configuration.

## Environment
| Device | VLAN | Addressing |
|--------|------|------------|
| Internal File Server | 50 | Static |
| Factory Machine Server | 50 | Static |
| Laptop1 | 40 | DHCP |
| Internal2 | 10 | DHCP |
| Machine Interface | 20 | DHCP |

---

## Validation Method
Each device’s IP configuration is verified through the OS network settings
to confirm correct DHCP or static assignment and default gateway.

## Expected Results
| Device | Address Type | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Laptop1 (VLAN 40) | DHCP | PASS |
| Internal2 (VLAN 10) | DHCP | PASS |
| Machine Interface (VLAN 20) | DHCP | PASS |
| File Server (VLAN 50) | Static | PASS |
| Factory Server (VLAN 50) | Static | PASS |

## Test Steps
1. Power on all devices.
2. Open network settings.
3. Verify:
   - VLAN 10/20/40 → DHCP
   - VLAN 50 servers → Static IP
4. Confirm default gateway is correct.
5. Capture screenshots.

## Outcome
**PASS** — Addressing strategy is correctly enforced across the network.
