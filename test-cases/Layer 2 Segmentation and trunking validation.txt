# Layer 2 VLAN Segmentation & 802.1Q Trunking Validation

## Purpose
Verify that departmental and service-based traffic is segmented at Layer 2
using VLANs, while 802.1Q trunk links allow tagged VLAN traffic to traverse
between switches. Confirm that the distribution layer provides inter-VLAN
routing.

## Environment
| VLAN | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 10 | Int_Data | Internal Users |
| 20 | Factory_Data | Factory Systems |
| 30 | Voice | VoIP |
| 40 | Guest | Guest Access |
| 50 | Int_Server | Internal Servers |
| 99 | MGMT | Network Management |

Devices:
- **Distro** – Inter-VLAN routing & trunk aggregation  
- **Switch1, Switch2, Switch3** – Access switches  

---

## Validation Method
VLAN configuration and trunk propagation are verified using switch
show commands. A new endpoint is added to VLAN 20 to confirm that VLANs
are propagated across the switching fabric.

## Expected Results
| Check | Expected Result |
|-------|-----------------|
| VLANs present on Distro | PASS |
| VLANs allowed on trunks | PASS |
| Access ports in correct VLAN | PASS |
| VLAN 20 reachable across switches | PASS |

## Test Steps

### Distribution Switch
1. Connect to device.
2. Run:show ip interface brief
show interfaces trunk
show vlan brief
show interfaces trunk


### VLAN Propagation Test
1. Add a new PC to Switch1.
2. Assign the port to VLAN 20.
3. Ping a VLAN 20 device on another switch.
4. Capture screenshots.

## Outcome
**PASS** — VLAN segmentation and trunking operate correctly across the
switching infrastructure.
