Layer 2 Redundancy & Spanning Tree Validation (802.1w)

## Purpose
Verify that Spanning Tree Protocol is correctly implemented to provide
Layer 2 redundancy while preventing switching loops and broadcast storms.
Confirm that the Distribution switch is elected as the root bridge.

---

## Environment
| Device | Role |
|--------|------|
| Distro | Root Bridge (All VLANs) |
| Switch1 | Access Switch |
| Switch2 | Access Switch |
| Switch3 | Access Switch |

STP Mode: **PVST (802.1w/Rapid STP)**  
Root Bridge: **Distro**

---

## Validation Method
Spanning Tree status is verified using `show spanning-tree` on all
switches to confirm:
- Root bridge election
- Port roles (Root, Designated, Alternate)
- Redundant path blocking

---

## Expected Results
| Device | Root Bridge | Redundant Links |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Distro | SELF | N/A |
| Switch1 | Distro | One blocked |
| Switch2 | Distro | One blocked |
| Switch3 | Distro | One blocked |

---

## Test Steps
1. Access Distro and verify root bridge status:
2. Access each access switch and verify:
- Root bridge = Distro
- One redundant port in blocking/alternate state
3. Capture screenshots.

## Outcome
**PASS** — STP successfully provides redundancy and prevents Layer 2 loops.
