# OSPF Dynamic Routing Validation

## Purpose
Verify that OSPF is correctly exchanging routing information between the
Distribution and Core layers, enabling dynamic route updates, inter-VLAN
connectivity, and upstream reachability.

## Validation Method
OSPF is verified by confirming neighbor adjacency, learned routes,
and end-to-end connectivity using the following commands:

show ip ospf neighbor
show ip route ospf
