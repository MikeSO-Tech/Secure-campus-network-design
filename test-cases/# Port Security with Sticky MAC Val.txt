# Port Security with Sticky MAC Validation

## Purpose
Verify that switch port security using sticky MAC addresses prevents
unauthorized devices from accessing the network by restricting each
access port to approved endpoints.

---

## Environment
| Device | VLAN | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| Switch1 | 50 | Server Access |
| Switch2 | 10 | User Access |
| Switch3 | 20 | Factory Access |

Security Mode: **Port Security (Sticky MAC, Restrict/Shutdown)**

---

## Validation Method
Port security behavior is verified by:
1. Allowing a valid device to connect and be learned.
2. Replacing it with an unauthorized device.
3. Observing the resulting security violation and port state.

## Expected Results
| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Authorized device connects | PASS |
| Unauthorized device connects | Port violation |
| Port state | Restrict / Shutdown |
| Log generated | PASS |

---

## Test Steps
1. Connect authorized device to secured port.
2. Verify learned MAC:
	show port-security interface fa0/1
3. Disconnect authorized device.
4. Connect unauthorized device.
5. Verify violation:
	show port-security interface fa0/1

6. Capture screenshots.
