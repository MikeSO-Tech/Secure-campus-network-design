# Troubleshooting Summary & Lessons Learned

## Overview
During the design and implementation of the Secure Campus Network,
multiple configuration and integration issues were encountered and
resolved using a structured, OSI-layered troubleshooting approach
(Layers 1–4).

Common diagnostic tools used:
- `ping`
- `show running-config`
- `show ip interface brief`
- `show ip route`
- `ipconfig`

Each issue below was identified, isolated, and corrected using
methodical validation.

## Issue 1: Guest ACL Blocking External Access

**Symptom:**  
Guest VLAN devices could not reach the ISP file server.

**Root Cause:**  
The ACL referenced an incorrect destination network.

**Resolution:**  
Reviewed ACL entries, corrected source/destination subnets, and
reapplied the policy.

**Result:**  
Guest devices regained external access while remaining isolated
from internal networks.

## Issue 2: Wireless Router DHCP Conflict (WRT300N)

**Symptom:**  
Wireless clients received incorrect IP addresses and could not
reach internal resources.

**Root Causes:**
- DHCP service enabled on WRT300N
- Router connected via Internet port instead of Ethernet port

**Resolutions:**
- Disabled DHCP on the wireless router
- Reconnected router using Ethernet interface

**Result:**  
Wireless devices received correct addresses from the network DHCP
server and gained connectivity.

## Issue 3: NTP Synchronization Failure

**Symptom:**  
Only the Core router could synchronize with the external NTP server.

**Root Cause:**  
The ISP router lacked a return route to the internal network.

**Resolution:**  
Reviewed routing tables and added the missing route on the ISP router.

**Result:**  
All devices successfully synchronized time via NTP.

## Issue 4: DHCP Default Gateway Missing

**Symptom:**  
End devices could communicate locally but could not route beyond
their subnet.

**Root Cause:**  
Missing `default-router` configuration in the DHCP pools.

**Resolution:**  
Added the correct gateway IP addresses to each DHCP pool.

**Result:**  
End devices could route traffic across VLANs and to the WAN.

## Conclusion
These issues demonstrate the importance of:
- Layered troubleshooting
- Verification of routing and addressing
- Reviewing control-plane dependencies (ACLs, NTP, DHCP, routing)

Each failure strengthened the final design and improved overall
network reliability.
